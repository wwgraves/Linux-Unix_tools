# Linux-Unix_tools
A few little Linux/Unix tools I put together to save time
I'm providing 4 files here:
1) add_count.csh (this creates a single-column text file of numeric counts)
2) add_dummy.csh (creates a dummy column of repeating numbers or text)
3) gravey-utils_1.0.1+0.2_amd64.deb (contains the above 2 files plus a list of dependencies)

Note that the "add_count.csh" script has a *huge* dependency: AFNI.
That may be a deal breaker for those who don't already use AFNI.
But for those like me who do, it adds just a bit of functionality that I find useful
when writing shell scripts in tcsh.
